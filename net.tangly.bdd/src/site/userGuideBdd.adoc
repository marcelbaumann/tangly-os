== Features

A behavior driven development __BDD__ library that provides a custom extension based on JUnit 5 Jupiter Extension Model.
This library can be used to create and run features, stories and behaviors as BDD specification tests.

The library promotes a test engineer approach.
The test cases are programmed against the system under development.
Upon execution the living documentation of all features and their associated stories are generated.
This document describes the behavior of the system as it is tested.

The library is implemented as an extension to the de facto standard JUnit5 for unit testing in the Java ecosystem.

Tags and identifiers are supported for regulatory aspects and traceability.

=== Scenarios

[source,java]

@ExtendWith(StoryExtension.class)
@Story(value = "Returns go back to the stockpile", description = "As a store owner, in order to keep track of stock, I want to add items back to stock when they're returned.")
public class StoreTestStoryOne {
    @Scenario("Refunded items from the customer should be returned to stock")
    public void refundAndRestock(Scene scene) {
        scene.given("that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me", t -> t.put("store", new Store(0, 4).buyBlack(1))).
            and("I have three black sweaters in stock", t -> assertEquals(3, t.<Store>get("store").blacks(), "Store should carry 3 black sweaters")).

            when("the customer returns the black sweater for a refund", t -> t.<Store>get("store").refundBlack(1)).

            then("I should have four black sweaters in stock", t -> assertEquals(4, t.<Store>get("store").blacks(), "Store should carry 4 black sweaters")).
            run();
    }
