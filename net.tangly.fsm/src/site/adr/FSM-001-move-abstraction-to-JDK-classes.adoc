=== 001. Replace Guard and Action classes with JDK BiPredicate and BiFunction Classes

Date: 2017-06-01

==== Status

Implemented

==== Context

We need a legible data model for finite state machine definitions.

==== Decision

We use standard classes of the JDK to minimize contextual complexity when learning and using the FSM library. We will evaluate if the loss of
domain names for classes could have a negative impact of the legibility of the library.

==== Consequences

We have a cleaner and simpler interface and have increase dependency to regular JDK classes. The generic names of the guard predicate and functional
action should not diminish the legibility of the source code. The role of the type is defined through the name of the parameter in the method
signature.
