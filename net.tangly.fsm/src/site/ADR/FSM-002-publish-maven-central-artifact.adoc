=== 002. Publish Artifacts on Public Java Components Repository

Date: 2019-05-01

==== Status

Implemented

==== Context

The library is enough mature to be used in public commercial and academic projects.

==== Decision

The library shall be published on maven central and be accessible to a wide range of developers and organizations. A web site shall be set up to
provide adequate documentation for users.

The ADR FSM-001 supports this evaluation.

==== Consequences

* We have to establish a publishing process at the company level to deploy signed artifacts to maven central repository.
* We have to establish a public web site to host the documentation of public published libraries
* We have to support semantic versioning for all future releases of public published libraries
