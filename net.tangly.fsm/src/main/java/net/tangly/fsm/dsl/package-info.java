/**
 * <h2>Introduction</h2> The domain specific language is used to build finite state machine
 * definitions. Lambda expressions are of course supported. The DSL assumes that you are working
 * with a state. Once you have retrieved the state you want to modify you can <ul> <li>addToRoot a
 * new state to a composite state and configure the state properties</li> <li>addToRoot a local
 * transition and configure its event, guard and action. You can addToRoot local transitions and
 * self transitions.</li> <li>addToRoot a transition to another state and configure the transition
 * event, guard and action</li> </ul> The first aspect you configure when adding is always the event
 * triggering the firing of the transaction. The order of all other properties is open.
 * <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li>use enums for states and events - resulting in single class state
 * machine definitions statically checked</li> <li>transition, entry and exit actions. The actions
 * must have either a unique parameter of type Event or no parameters</li> <li>transition guards.
 * The guards must have either a unique parameter of type Event or no parameters.</li>
 * <li>hierarchical states with history behavior to initialize state always to same state or last
 * active state</li> <li>fluent definition syntax</li> <li>extensible thorough event handlers
 * simplify logging, auditing and debugging</li> <li>state machine reports as text, csv or yEd
 * diagram</li> </ul>
