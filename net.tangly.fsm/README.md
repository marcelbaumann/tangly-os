##Purpose
The *tangly fsm* is a finite state machine library written in Java 8. You can use it in productive projects or academic 
assignments.

The library provides

* Definition of hierarchical state machine descriptions. The machine states and transitions are generic classes. You provide an enumeration for the set of states, and an enumeration for the set of events triggering the machine. The builder pattern is used to create complex state machine definition declaratively.
* Actions are implemented as consumer lambda expressions, guard are predicate lambda expressions. The standard library of Java 8 is extensively used.
* A runtime engine processing events on a finite state machine description. Multiple instances of the same description can be instantiated. The class owning the state machine is passed as context to all guards and actions.
* Support classes to implement listeners and logging are provided. A documentation helper can generate a graphical representation of a state machine using the graph dot language.
  
You will find extensive documentation under ./src/site/userguide-fsm.md

##Tips and Tricks
###Run the unit tests
The unit tests uses in some cases the [quasar](http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/) library. The library needs to 
instrument the compiled code to run correctly. You must configure the java interpreter to use a java agent.
