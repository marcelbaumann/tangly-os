/**
 * The application can be used by mvn install (once) mvn (to run the application) The package provides a CRUD component for entities. Entities can have
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A list displaying a list of entities with selected properties.</li>
 *     <li>A tabbed details view showing simple properties view, comments view, tags view. The comments and tags view display again a list of
 *     values.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The composite field abstractions cover two scenarios. Composite fields for immutable entities cannot use a binder. We provide a validator method to return
 * validation logic for all internal fields. Regular beans providing at least getters for properties can be connected with a binder. Here we provide a
 * binding method to connect the bean properties with converters and validators declared in the binder.</p>
