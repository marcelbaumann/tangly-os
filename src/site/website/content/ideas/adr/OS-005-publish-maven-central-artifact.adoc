== FSM-002 Publish Artifacts on Public Java Components Repository

Date: 2019-05-01

=== Status

Superseed: FSM-0002

=== Context

The {ref-tangly} open source libraries are mature enough to be used in public commercial and academic projects.
The libraries were used in internal projects and  refined to  fulfill these requirements.
More customers will validate the usefulness of the library and identify extensions for further releases.

=== Decision

The libraries shall be published as artifacts on maven central and be accessible to a wide range of developers and organizations.
A website shall be set up to provide an adequate documentation for users.

The https://tangly-team.bitbucket.io[Technical Documentation] will use a static web approach to minimize costs and provide good legibility.

The libraries will be published on Maven Central to maximize potential usage.

=== Consequences

* We have to establish a publishing process at the company level to deploy signed artifacts to maven central repository.
 See link:../ideas/components-publication[release and publication process]
* We have to establish a public website to host the documentation of public published libraries.
 The static website is {ref-site}
* We have to support semantic versioning for all future releases of public published libraries.
