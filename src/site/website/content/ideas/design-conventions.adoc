=== Audit Event Conventions

The _event_ field is one of of the following values

import :: any entity imported from an external source is audited
export :: any entity exported to an external source is audited
create :: each time a file is generated and exported shall be audited.
For example the creation of an invoice document is audited.
login :: login of a user
logout :: logout of a user

The _component_ field is one of the tangly component

* net.tangly.bus
* net.tangly.commons
* net.tangly.dev
* net.tangly.fsm
* net.tangly.gleam
* net.tangly.ports
* net.tangly.commons.ui.vaadin

=== Java Conventions

==== Modern Java Constructs

Use modern Java constructs in our daily coding

* Prefer record over class construct to promote immutable objects
* Prefer stream use over explicit control statements to promote functional programming
* Promote modules for information hiding and reducing coupling between components
* Experiment with var construct to find out if code is more legible

==== toString Method

The method implementation uses a _String.format()_ approach.
We assume that Java will introduce intrinsics support for an efficient implementation of toString method based on _String.format()_.
As soon as the intrisics is available we will migrate to the supported version as stated in JEP 348.

The _toString_ method is used to create detailed audit and looging messages and support production error searching.
The format of the message is based on the build-in format defined in the JDK for Java records.

=== Design Conventions

Use plantUML to document all design decisions.
