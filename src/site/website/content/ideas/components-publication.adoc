=== Maven Central Publication

The following process is used to publish {ref-tangly} open source component on https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven Central].

. Publish artifacts of component with the script `uploadToMavenCentral.sh`.
 Do not use the gradle task `gradle publishAllPublicationsToMavenRepository -Pmode=prod`.
 Sonatype cannot handle parallel upload of multiple components and simply close the connections during upload (Status 2020-Q2).
.. Pre activity: test publishing with `gradle publishToMavenLocal`
.. Pre activity: check on bitbucket the project compile through the *CI* continuous integration pipeline
.. Post activity: *tag repository* on git to identify the version of the published packages.
 The tag version semantic part *must* be the same as the package version on https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central[Maven Central]
 The tag is of the form -{AcronymComponent}-MajorVersion-MinorVersion-PatchVersion-
.. Verify with `git tag label` and `git push origin --tags`
. Log into https://oss.sonatype.org/#welcome[Sonatype Maven Central Repository]
.. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories[Staging Repositories]
.. Find your temporary repository at the end of list
.. Review the content of the repository
.. Close the repository -button on tool list-
.. Close stage is initiated and checks are performed.
 If everything was fine the content is published.
.. Release the artifact -button on tool list-
. See <<website-publication>> to update the website

[CAUTION]
====
It takes up to one day until the component is visible in Maven Central website upon publication.

The last publications were performed in less than 30 minutes.

The acronyms are (the current composite acronym is TANGLY_OS meaning all components are released)

* *BDD* behavior driven development library
* *BUS* business components library
* *COMMONS* commons library
* *DEV* development tools library
* *FSM* hierarchical finite state machine library
* *GLEAM* declarative model transformation frameworks library
* *PORTS* ports library
* *UI* Vaadin user interface library

Below the dependencies between tangly open source components as defined in the multi-modules {ref-gradle} build file.

==== Decisions

. The open source components are stored in a mono repository.
 Each component is declared as a gradle module.
. We use de facto standard Git.
. We are hosted at https://bitbucket.org[bibucket].
. The bitbucket repository is regularly synchronized with a github mirror repository https://github.com/marcelbaumann/tangly-os.git[github].

The synchronization is performed with the command

[code]
----
git push --prune https://github.com/marcelbaumann/tangly-os.git +refs/remotes/origin/*:refs/heads/* +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
----

==== Findings

. We needed to manually publish the public key on http://keys.gnupg.net[keys.gnupg.net]
. Gradle build file has a condition include to disable the signing plugin on the CI pipeline because keys and associated authentication are not available.
 I decided not to upload private keys to https://bitbucket.org/[bitbucket].
 See the documentation at the beginning of the Gradle build file for details.

IMPORTANT: Set the property if you want to sign the component artifacts and publish to Maven Central.

==== Configure asciidoctor

The new version of hugo support configuration of asciidoctor through config.toml therefore no manipulation of asciidoctor is needed.
As a bonus the file generated by PlantUml are created in the correct folder.
We still need to install the referenced packages.

[code]
----
sudo gem install asciidoctor-diagram
sudo gem install asciidoctor-rouge
sudo gem install asciidoctor-html5s
sudo gem install asciimath
----

==== Create Website

The tangly open source components website is hosted https://tangly-team.bitbucket.io/[here].

Read the instructions in the asciidoctor script file under the scripts folder.
Four scripts are provided to generate the Hugo static site with associated structure and theme.

. the script _initiateHugo.sh_ creates the layout of the site and retrieve the theme.
. the script _populateHugo.sh_ populates the site with our content.

Upon completion of local development you must start a local Hugo server and generate the indexing files for https://lunrjs.com/[lunr] search.
Before uploading the site stop the Hugo local server.

. the script _completeHugo.sh_ generates the static pictures and copy them to the static folder and publish the whole site on bitbucket.

Upon completion the site is published on the web for all.
