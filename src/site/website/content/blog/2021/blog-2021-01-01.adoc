=== Zones

==== Shift Team Culture: _Focusing_ teams produce business value (2 - 6 months)

The team generates their own day-to-day tasks and plan (based on their business representative’s needs).
Team members consider their plan to be the team’s work, not individuals’ work.
Team members share accountability for getting their plan done.
Management considers the plan to be the team’s work rather than assigning accountability to individuals.

Select team members with appropriate skills, background, and willingness to work together.
Allocate them 100% to their team.

* Create a productivity-focused shared workspace, strongly preferring a physical team room.
 If a physical team room is infeasible, provide a richly interactive virtual workspace instead, and accept that this will be less effective.
* Ensure that someone with expertise on business priorities and customer value is available to act as the team’s business representative.
*  Remove impediments to effective teamwork such as competitive ranking, individual rewards, and distributed teams.
* Coach and train team members in Focusing proficiencies.
* Train managers to create an environment that supports teamwork  and how to manage the work system rather than individual contributions.

==== Shift Team Skills: _Delivering_ teams deliver on the market cadence (3 - 24 months)

Increase Productivity The team has low defect rates, so less time is wasted fixing bugs and more time is invested in making improvements.
Increase Productivity The team’s codebase has low technical debt, which makes changes cheaper and faster.
Increase ROI The team ships on the market cadence, capturing value as often as the market will bear

When working with code and similar artifacts, team members leave its technical quality at least slightly better than they found it.
Production releases are automated and take no more than ten minutes of manual effort.
The team produces production-grade code without requiring a manual testing phase.
All team members are aware of how their professional and technical skills affect their ability to accomplish the team’s goals and decrease their maintenance costs.
They proactively seek to improve those skills.

==== Shift Organizational Structure: _Optimizing_ teams lead their market (1 - 5 years)
