Lately I was asked which new approaches should be used for agile requirements engineering, Did we find a new silver bullet to write software specifications the agile way?

The answer is an easy oone.
We do not need new approaches and complicated processes.
Start with proven principles and learn.

Impact mapping and story mapping are a successful way to identify and priorize your functions.
Specifications by examples and stories as a discussion allow you to refine your understanding.

Acceptance testing verifies the implementation fulfills the expected behavior.
You get for free the mechanism to avoid regression problems when releasing your application.

The associated theory was published in seminal books more than a decade ago.
Just start doing it.
You can still later improve your approach based on your learnings.

=== Approach

==== Specification

Use Impact mapping and story mapping to classify and order your functionality.
Story mapping works hand in hand with the release plan artifact I cited in the previous post.
The nice think is that impact mapping and story mapping is quite compatible with design thinking
We connect the different directions used in development departments.
Each specification story has acceptance criteria.

==== Validation

Acceptance criteria is a form of specification by example.
Acceptance tests - see ATDD and BDD - are the automatic check for specification by example.

The gain of implementing the acceptance criteria as ATDD is guaranteed elimination of regression issues.
You also get automatic generation of test plan, test results and requirement documents.
Your documents are always in sync with the source code of your product.

I had success with fitness functions (see thoughtworks) to describe and validate non-functional requirements.

=== Background

You could use following reference books

Specification by example::
 was published in 2011, twelve year ago,Impact Mapping was published in 2012, ten years ago,

User Story Mapping::
was published in 2014 eight years ago,

Building Evolutionary Architectures::
Fitness functions are decribed in this book and a recommended reference of my _SWAT Software Architecture and Techniques_ lecture.
I taught the course at the department of computer science of the technical university of Lucerne.
The book was published in 2017, five years ago.

=== Remarks

Scrum community clearly states that product backlog items (also stories in backlog) are not specifications.
They are work items.
If you want to use stories to describe your needs instead of specification by example, it is OK, but not in the backlog.
