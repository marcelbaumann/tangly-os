Students shall be proficient with a basic set of software development techniques.

* _Technical excellence_ is a mandatory skill for all software developers.
* _Agile development approaches_ are state of the industry and used almost all software development initiatives.
* _DevOps_ approaches are used in modern organizations.

Technical schools should provide in-depth experience in these areas to prepare their students to their future activities after completing their bachelor.

The below mind map consolidates concepts, tools and approaches based on the gitlab tooling established in some universities.

Italic terms identify concrete tools.
Green font marks Gitlab features.
Light blue background concepts map to technical university guidelines.

Yous should develop software applications using agile and DevOps techniques.
You shall put your source code under a version management system.
The actual industrial standard is https://git-scm.com/[git], a distributed version control system - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control[DVCS] -.

More sophisticated source code management systems based on git with additional agile and DevOps functionalities are

* https://github.com/[github] closed source solution and most well-known solution.
Microsoft acquired them in 2020.
Some Swiss technical universities - ZHAW, University of Bern - use the academic github campus program.
The program means you receive github licenses.
Your organization is responsible to run the software on premises.
* https://about.gitlab.com/[gitlab] open source solution and strong contender to github.
* https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview[Bitbucket] closed source solution of Attlassian.
Attlassian also owns JIRA, Confluence and Trello.
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/[Azure Devops] closed source solution and Microsoft answer for .NET development.
They slowly open to additional development stacks.
* https://gitea.io/[Gitea] Gitea is a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go.
The project is hosed on Github.
It is published under the MIT license.
* https://gogs.io/[Gogs] A painless self-hosted Git service.
The project is hosed on Github.
* https://gitolite.com/[gitolite] Gitolite allows you to set up git hosting on a central server.
It has fine-grained access control and many more powerful features.

School often select gitlab due to his open source license and the tremendous DevOps functionality.
The gitlab solution supports source code versioning, DevOps pipelines, agile development approaches, and quality insurance for the produced artifacts.

=== Basic Git for Students

Any developer can create a git hosted project with a few commands in the shell.

[NOTE]
====
Linux distributions often include the git application.
If not use the package manager to download and install git.

MacOS users should use https://brew.sh/[homebrew] as package manager.
Homebrew can download and install a huge set of Unix packages.To install git you just have to execute _brew install git_.

The huge advantage of package managers is the update function to install new versions of your applications without any configuration activities.

You are a Windows user you can find a Windows package on the : https://git-scm.com/downloads[git home page].
====

Git has 3 different _areas_ for your code:

Working directory::
The area that you will be doing all of your work in (creating, editing, deleting, and organizing files)
Staging area::
The area where you will list the changes that you have made to the working directory
Repository::
Where Git permanently stores the changes you have made as different versions of the project

[code,shell]
----
git init // <1>
git clone https://gitlab.enterpriselab.ch/tangly/tangly-os.git // <2>

git add README.md // <3>
git add * // <4>

git commit -m "commit message, should be clear and legible" // <5>
git push // <6>
git pull // <7>

git status // <8>
git remote // <9>
git --version // <10>
----
<1>  Create a repository for the root folder of your project, the folder _.git_ is created and contains all the git tracking information.
<2>  Clone the repository _tangly-os_ and copy all files into the current folder.
<3>  Add the README file to git.
<4>  Add all files to git.
<5>  Commit files.
<6>  Push files to the remote repository you cloned in step 2.
Your changes are now public and available to other developers.
<7>  Pull files from the remote repository you clone in step 2 Your local repository contains the last public changes of other developers.
<8>  Returns status information about your local project.
<9>  Returns the list of remote repositories your project is connected to.
Often you have just one remote to synchronize with.
<10> Displays the version of your git installation.

See our blog ../../2017/git-local-repositories-for-the-impatient[Git Local Repositories For the Impatient].

See our blog ../../2016/git-branches-for-the-impatient[Git Branches for the Impatient] for more advanced commands.

=== CI Pipelines for Students

image::2021-01-03-cicd_pipeline.png[720,480,role=left]

The minimal gradle build file of a Java project is very simple and compact

[code,gradle]
----
apply plugin: 'java'
----

Multi-module Gradle build file requires an additional _gradle.settings_ file identifying your modules.
The initial build file for each module is the same as for a minimal gradle project.

[code,gradle]
----
include 'net.tangly.bdd'
include 'net.tangly.bus'
include 'net.tangly.commons'
----

You can now compile, test and check your application

[code,bash]
----
gradle build // <1>
gradle test // <2>
gradle check // <3>
gradle clean // <4>
----
<1> Compile the simple or multi-module Java project.
<2> Execute the unit tests of the project.
<3> Perform static analysis checks if you define them.
<4> Clean the output folders and delete all generated files.

You are now ready to create a complete continuous integration pipeline of your project in gitlab.
A complete _.gitlab-ci.yml_ configuration for a gradle project would be:

[source,yaml]
----
image: openjdk:15

variables:

before_script:
  - export GRADLE_USER_HOME=`pwd`/.grade

stages:
  - build
  - test

build:
  stage: build
  script: ./gradlew --build-cache assemble
  cache:
    key: "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"
    policy: push
    paths:
      - build
      - .gradle

test:
  stage: test
  script: ./gradlew check
  cache:
    key: "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"
    policy: pull
    paths:
      - build
      - .gradle

----

=== Java Development Environment

[WARNING]
====
Please prefer a workstation powered with Linux or MacOS if you are developing in Java, Groovy or Python.

You will be more efficient and avoid all the problems related to virus scanners, missing packages or arcane path length problems.
====

. Install the latest LTS JDK and latest JDK on your workstation.
. Install IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Students can request a student license and work with the Ultimate edition.
The community edition is free for everybody.
. Use the static analysis function of IntelliJ IDEA has a static analysis feature.
.. Select the file or package to inspect in the project view.
.. Click the right mouse button to display the context menu and select the menu item _Analyze/Inspect Code..._.
The findings will teach you how to write better Java code and eliminate common errors.
. Install Gradle to build your application

IntelliJ IDEA environment provides all the tools to work efficiently locally.
All the tools identified in the above mindmap are supported in IDE and associated plugins.
Students can work offline and learn the tools in a gentle manner.

The students can use the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-inspections.html[IDEA Static Code Analyzer] without any additional configuration.
The quality is good enough and the feature empowers junior developers to learn modern and correct Java code.

More advanced scenarios use https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs] and the associated IDEA plugin.

=== How to Write Unit Tests for a Java Application

You should write unit and integration tests for your Java application using

* https://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit 5]
* https://site.mockito.org/[Mockito]
* https://assertj.github.io/doc/[AssertJ]

=== How to Document Your Project

Static code generators are becoming the standard approach for technical documentation.
One huge advantage is you can check the whole documentation into your git repository.
You have now a synchronisation between a released version of your application and the corresponding documentation.
Both are stored in the same repository and can be marked with a version label You can use

* https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown]
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]
* https://gohugo.io/[Hugo]

IntelliJ has native support for markdown and an excellent plugin for Asciidoc.

Gitlab provides the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/[Pages] concept to create and publish a complete documentation of a product.

=== Diagrams

image::2021-01-03-diagrams.png[720,480,role=left]

https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] is a simple and powerful tool for diagramming.
The tool is compatible with git philosophy and static website generators.

The IntelliJ Asciidoc is used to write technical documentation and to display embedded PlantUML diagrams.
Asciidoc format has native support for PlantUML diagrams.

Students have training in technical notations such as UML, BPNM, C4 and others.
They can now apply these notations to their projects using plantUML.

=== Agile and Scrum

Students have training in agile development and the Scrum framework.
Gitlab allows them to apply these https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/[Agile Delivery Concepts] to their semester and bachelor projects.
Lecturers have access to the agile and Scrum artifacts and can qualify the quality of the work.

=== Advanced Git for Complex Team Development

* Merge
* Rebase
* Squash
* Cherry Picking
* Local and Remote Branch
* Pull Request
