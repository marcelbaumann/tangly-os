Agile approaches advocate dynamic planning and adaptation to new inputs and priority changes.
The {ref-bbrt} movement promotes rolling planning, budgeting and reporting.

The beyond budgeting techniques recommend complete abolition of traditional budgeting processes.
They require the implementation of new techniques that will replace them.
The BB framework does not specify the exact techniques that are applicable to all companies.

However, there are some techniques that have proven to be effective in real cases in the past. These techniques include the following:

* Rolling forecasts are created monthly or quarterly rather than annually.
* Company’s targets are based on key performance indicators _KPI_.
* The performance of the company’s managers is evaluated based on external benchmarks rather than their past performance.
* Operational managers are empowered to react to the changes in the business environment and can dynamically coordinate their actions.

What are the consequences of rolling approaches to any CRM or ERP system?

=== Accounting

Rolling accounting is quite easy.

You shall display only transactions bocked during the selected time interval.
You shall be able to generate the balance sheet for the date defining the start of the time interval.

The data is usable only if your accounting department does not tune the accounts at the end of quarter or at the end of the year.
For example, Swiss companies shall separate the rolling accounting from their legal accounting used for VAT or earnings tax purposes.
A better approach is to define rules avoiding most of the tuning actions.

=== Customers, Activities and Offers

=== Contracts and Projects

Only the contracts and projects active in the selected time interval shall be displayed.
Efforts booked during the time interval are relevant for the analytics.

=== Invoices


=== Implementation

The tangly ERP was extended to support rolling analytics based on a user defined time interval.

The system supports the definition of a time interval to display only currently relevant entities.

The analytics time interval is independent from the system overall interval.
