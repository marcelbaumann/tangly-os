Java development won traction since the decision to release every six months a new version to the community.
Preview and incubator features promote feedback from the community and users.

Some tool builders such as JetBrains are working proactively and provide support for JDK in developments.
Other tool maintainers such as JaCoCo are dreadfully being the release cycle.

We learnt to deal with the new speed and how to tackle the laggards.
Some experiences were quite painful.
Below our findings and our current focus to develop.

=== Legibility Matters

Programmers learnt the last decade that legibility and brevity of programming languages matter.
The Java Coin project was initiated to reduce the verbosity of the Java language mainly through syntactic sugar.
As a programmer I should not be forced to write statements the compiler could infer.

Examples of improvements are

* diamond operators _to avoid writing two times the same generic parameter declarations_,
* try with resources _to avoid complicated finally blocks to close resources_,
* multiple catch of exceptions _to avoid writing multiple time the same error handling block_,
* var local variables _to avoid complex declarations of  local variables_,
* default methods in interfaces _to avoid declaring the same method in multiple classes_,
* Strings as switch selector _to write readable code instead of huge if statements_,
* Underscore in numerical constants _to increase legibility_.

Deeper changes are

* New date API simplifying the handling of date and time logic.
The solution is based on the learnings of the https://www.joda.org/joda-time/[Joda] time library.

=== Useful Constructs

Modern Java has introduced powerful constructs to write legible and maintainable code. Modern Java code is quite different from Java 5 code.

Java Modules::
 Dependencies management supported at language level.
 _The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)/[Ada] programming language has support for module since 1985_.
Streams and Lambda::
 Support of functional programming approaches
 Streams are declarative and support internal iterators.
 _The Booch Ada component library supported internal iterators since 1985_.
Record::
 Very compact notation to define a data class and transparent handling of properties
 Immutable objects
 Modern naming for getters and setters
Sealed Types::
 Interesting way to restrict inheritance to a set of selected classes.
 Very helpful for library designers.
 You can publish an interface in the public API and limit the classes implementing this interface.
Reflection versus Lambda::
 References to methods and constructors are part of the lambda extension.
 The _LambdaMetafactory_ class allows to create a reference at runtime.
 Therefore reflection operations can be replaced by lambda expressions.
 The code is more performant and has security issues.
Text Blocks::
 Finally we can write legible multi-lines strings.

=== Cumbersome Aspects

We have still open wounds in the legibility and elegance of the Java programming languages.

* Unsolved legibility problems through annotations polluting your domain model,
* Null values,
* Fluent interface when setting multiple properties in an instance,
* Missing support for modifiable properties (read-only properties have initial support in the record construct),
* Missing logging interface similar to http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j],
* Reified generics to have access to generic types during runtime.

=== Next Improvements?
We have the first signs of possible improvements.
A more concise notation for getters and setters::
 The record extension finally provides a more concise and legible convention for getter and setters.
 I hope the convention will be used in all new library classes.

Type property();
void property(Type property);

Stop using checked exceptions and replace them with runtime exception::
 Lambda expressions cannot handle checked exceptions.
 Only runtime exceptions can be thrown in a lambda expression.
 Experience with other programming languages show that checked exceptions do not provide gains in the quality of delivered code.
Pattern matching with deconstruction::
 First pattern matching constructs are available in switch and if statements.
 Discussions are underway to extend pattern matching with object deconstruction.
Value Types::
 Value types would be a huge improvement in performance and support of modern processor architecture if the Valhalla project delivers.

The only caution we have with modern Java development is the sluggish catch-up of open source tools and libraries.
For example {ref-gradle} needed five years to provide module support in the Java plugin.
Gradle 6.4 was the first version really supporting Java modules.
