=== External Well-Defined Identifiers

The best identifiers are externally well-defined identifiers. Examples are

* Currency names as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217[ISO standard 4217],
* Country abbreviations as define in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes[ISO standard 3166],
* Social security numbers are well documented in the country they are used,
* Car numbers are well-known and documented.

As much as possible try to use global identifiers. Examples are

* IBAN account numbers are defined worldwide through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number[ISO 13616],
* Car number and country acronym are defined worldwide,
* Passport numbers are defined worldwide. But each country has its own structure,
* Social security numbers are a counter example. Their are currently only defined locally.

=== External Managed Identifiers

=== Internal Managed Identifiers

One possible approach is to define a naming convention such as

Year - Acronym - Counter

An example of such an identifier would be

    2021-CNT-0001 (Contract number 1 in year 2021)
    2020-EVT-0101 (Event  number 101 in year 2020)

Variations are

* A full date as prefix, our system uses this convention to name invoices
* A more readable acronym, our system uses the word invocie to name invoices

=== Lessons Learnt

Always try to find an external well-defined identifier for your entitites.

Avoid by all means to use an internal privately defined identifier as a public one.
You will bear the burden to document, manage and evolve the scheme as soon as you do this.
