As a modern leader, you are aware of the importance of transforming your organization to become more agile.
Indeed, you have been successful already in implementing first steps.
But things are not moving forward as quickly as they should, especially in the current challenging situation.
The leadership behaviour of your colleagues is only changing slowly.
While the adjustments and decisions needed to drive the transformation forward get stuck in the cog works of the organization

They clearly acknowledged that this

is only need because administration are strongly hierarchical and unable to adapt to changes over the development of the solution.

=== Where we Stand

The agile approach continues to spread rapidly around the world: 89.8% of all teams have already adopted or are in the process of adopting agile methodology, a considerable number.
On the other hand, organizations are still struggling to build greater company-wide agility and only a few have already adopted agility on a portfolio (15.3%) or strategic level (8.2%).
The good news is that many companies have started transformation initiatives or are planning to do so in the near future.
=== Findings

Going fully agile is challenging and sticking with waterfall is not an option.
This has left many, about 40% to be exact, stuck in a hybrid approach, i.e., a combination of waterfall and agile.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, if you manage to get the best of both worlds.
Kanban offers an easy start with agile and unlike Scrum is applicable to any process.
As our numbers show, it is becoming more and more popular.
But remember, it is not Kanban if it doesn't have WIP limits.
There is also a trend towards stable product teams that extend their responsibilities beyond those of "just" the development of a solution or service.

=== Transformation Findings

* Happening mainly in IT and has not yet reached the Business,
* Going fully agile is challenging and sticking with waterfall is not an option, Leaving many stuck in a Hybrid Approach,
* Agile Development is more successful than waterfall,
* Satisfaction with the agile way of working is high; with the transformation is low,
* Leadership and culture are the main success factors.
Yet focus is on Processes over People,
* Team Accountability needs to be improved.
Decentralisation of decisions is too hard for many.
* Higher management has a way more optimistic view of the organization agility then middle management and collaborators.

=== Insights

Agile appraoches are steadily making progress in Switzerland.
We have reach the level where late majority and laggards are slowly looking the approach.
Progress is slow and resistance is very high.

Be positive.
This is the drawback of becoming a mainstream approach.

I am currently focusing on Software Craftsmanship and key agile values and approaches.
The more people know about key principles, the better the adoption and the implementation will be.
One decision was to teach and train bachelor students in these principles to implement a grassroot approach.

We still promote
