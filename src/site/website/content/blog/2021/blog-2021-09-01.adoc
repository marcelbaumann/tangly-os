The static website build tool {ref-hugo} is awesome.
The Hugo theme {ref-docsy} is ideal to create software documentation site.
I love to write my documentation and blogs using {ref-asciidoc} notation.

=== Search Function for the Website

The theme has multiple search solutions to index your static website.
I chose the https://lunrjs.com/[Lunr] approach for our site.
The solution has no strings attached and does not require an external search server.
The website and the search functionality are self-contained as a static website should be.

=== Comment Function for Blog Article

The comment feature is somewhat at odds with the concept of static website.
The theme has multiple comment solutions to allow readers to publish a question or a test to our site.
I decided to provide comments only to the blog part of the website.
I chose the https://utteranc.es/[Utterances] approach for our site.
The solution has no strings attached and uses the well-known platform GitHub.
No tracking, no ads and no locking are great.
The comment author must first login in GitHub before adding her comment therefore spamming or flaming are minimized.
