Everybody is talking about being agile.

Companies institutionalize agile change programs and send all their collaborators in training to learn the agile way.

What does that mean?

How should I as a manager work the agile way?
Does this agile way exits or is it simply a fad created by the consulting industry?

This article provides some pointers and hypotheses what agile leadership could be?

Fell free to experiment and refine your successful approach to be agile as an organization.

____
Organizational agility cannot exceed the level of personal leadership agility of those with the most influence in an organization.

Because agile leadership involves ongoing personal development, it is not something that can be mastered in a single training course.

Agile Leaders engage, empathize, and serve the team at the place of work.
Serving the team is all the rage these days. You hear or read about Servant Leadership at every turn. But serving the team is too often interpreted as waiting for the team to ask for help. Rather than wait for the team, go to the Gemba — the actual place of work¹. Get out of your office and engage with the team. Help them as they deliver. See their problems first hand. You will know exactly what they are working on. It will become obvious how you can help. You start helping and playing the part only you as a leader can fill. This is true service to the team by being a contributing member of the team.

Growing your team is critical.
By engaging shoulder to shoulder with your teams, you can help them grow.
As a leader, you can teach them how to navigate complexity.
You must engender an ability in your team members to think using the scientific method.
It is impossible to teach every possible scenario your teams will encounter.
Instead of teaching them how to probe, sense, and respond.
This will give them critical abilities to solve complex problems on their own.
And it builds self-organizing skills in your teams.
