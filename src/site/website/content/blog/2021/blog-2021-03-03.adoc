Slowly, slowly major actors in the software architecture landscape acknowledge agile development is state of the industry approach to build software products.
They are still struggling to integrate their older views in a faster, iterative, incremental development approach.
More important they have discovered we build products because no customers buy projects.
They buy solutions and products.

I am relieved I need less fighting to convince enterprise architects that agile is the way.
The big names https://www.pmi.org/[_Project Management Institute_], https://www.opengroup.org/[_Open Group_], and https://www.isaqb.org/[_iSAQB_]
have an agile architecture offering.
If pushed they acknowledge agile development is mainstream and huge in the overwhelming majority of product development.
But we have learnt that it is difficult to concede and congratulate the winning party.
Look at the president of the United States of America Donald Trump to have a well documented of a loser trying all lies and tricks to avoid the reality.
No long ago the tobacco industry did the same as professional liars.
And we still have the climate change deniers.

We show mercy to all the software architect and designer traditionalists who need almost twenty years to acknowledge the supremacy of agile approaches.

=== PMI and Disciplined Agile Delivery

PMI realized a few years ago their standard approach to project management was loosing ground.
The first step was the _PMI Agile Certified Practitioner_ certification to test what agile is.
The coup was their acquisition of _Disciplined Agile Delivery_ in the second half of 2019.
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery[DAD] approach is aroound since 2015 and had some success.
The framework has a complexity sympathetic to PMI.
The roots of a lot of concepts can be found in RUP, an interative and incremental methodology.
The founder of DAD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ambler[Scott W. Ambler] has a long history with the Unified Modeling Language and CMM.
But RUP is certainly not agile.

Anyway it is a huge step for PMI to move away from traditional heavy project development methods and to embrace somehow agile product development.
