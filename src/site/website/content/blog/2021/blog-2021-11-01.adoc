[quote, Michael Feathers]
____
OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.

Functional languages have the following properties:

* Functions are first-class objects. That is, functions can be created at runtime, passed around, returned, and in general, used like any other datatype.
* Data is immutable.
* Functions are pure; that is, they have no side effects.

For many tasks, functional programs are easier to understand, less error prone, and much easier to reuse.

(require package)
(doc name)
(find-doc regular-expression)
