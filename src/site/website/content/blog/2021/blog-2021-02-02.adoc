=== File System NIO

=== Unit Tests

=== Paths

=== Learnt Lessons

Legacy libraries heavily use File objects in their algorithms and their public interface.
Such libraries do not work with in-memory file systems.

The simplest approach is to always provide an API returning streams in addition of file systems methods.
It is always possible to map a stream to a file system specific streams for read and write operations.

The more complex approach is to replace all File objects with Path objects.
Ideally Java community should declare the File class as deprecated.
But, this approach would break backward compatibility.
