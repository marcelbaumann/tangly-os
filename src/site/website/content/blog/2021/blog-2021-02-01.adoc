Scaling Agile, Lean and {ref-scrum} to the whole article development department is hard work.
You start a change journey in murky waters.
Best to communicate a lot, strengthen your teams and have total support of upper management.
Technical agile coaching usefully describes the work I do.
Agile coaching helps your business to become more successful, often improve the way you plan and deliver software.

Technical agile coaching focuses on how people write code and deliver high quality products.

My aim is the same as other agile coaches. I improve the agility of the organizations I work with. I use coaching, mentoring, teaching and facilitation techniques just as other coaches do.

My main focus is on the way the code is written, the design is defined and the architecture is formulated.

=== Agile Approach

My own interpretation of agile as doctrine is:

Reduce the distance between problems and problem-solvers, practice Gemba
Take smaller steps, collect data, validate every step, update approach
Clean up as you go
Lead and cycle time is a measure of the organizational agility. Track them.

Do not ask for permission when you want to do continuous improvement. You are supposed to improve.
This is a core responsibility of your team.

You have the retrospectives to plan your improvements, and you must allocate time for implementing the improvement in every sprint.
{ref-scrum} is clear, at least one improvement measure is a high priority backlog item in the next sprint.

=== Ways of working

The following three levels of coaching are commonly needed:

==== Organizational Coaching

A coach works with multiple teams and the management to improve the organization and its structure.
A coach typically focuses on:

Having a clear vision of how an LeSS organization could be:

* Organizational structure and design
* {ref-less}
* Role of management
* Adoption and goals setting
* Managing an organizational improvement backlog
* Changing management practices from controlling day-to-day work to building capability
* Managing work: article backlogs and how the organization manages them
* Dealing with interruptions
* Human Resource practices such as appraisals and career paths
* Facilitating organizational release/roadmap planning and retrospectives

==== Team Coaching (or LeSS coaching)

A coach works with one or a few teams to improve their team-working and LeSS practices.
It is common for a coach to take on the Scrum Master role.
A team coach typically focuses on:

* Team responsibilities with self-managing teams
* Facilitation
* Improving the team’s decision making and conflict resolution
* Transparency in the team
* Making organizational impediments visible
* Improving the relationship between the Team and the Product Owner
* Product Ownership (of both the team, the PO, and other stakeholders)
* Role and contribution of the team’s management
* Improve Scrum practices (and technical practices)
* Educate and coach the team’s (future) Scrum Master

==== Technical Practices Coaching

A coach works with (or on) a team on their actual codebase in order to improve the technical practices and adopt agile development techniques such as simple design, refactoring, unit testing, test-driven development and acceptance test-driven development. A coach typically focuses on:

Discovering “code/design smells”. Places where code/design could be improved.
Explaining modern, “clean” code that is simple and easier to change and maintain.
Refactoring “smells” into clean code.
Writing unit tests.
Test-driven development.
Test Automation
Continuous integration and continuous delivery
Specification by Example (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)
Efficient and effective working practices (IDE, automation)
Applying design patterns

In all our mandates one major activity is improving legacy code.

[.text-center]
Legacy code is *Code without tests*

[.text-center]
Legacy code is *Profitable code that we feel afraid to change*

=== How Much Coaching?

The most successful LeSS adoptions we’ve see had the following structure:

[.text-center]
*One internal and one external coach*

This pair provides the overview of the {ref-less} adoption.
They both coach management but are also involved with team and technical coaching.

External team coaches who help the teams become better and focus on training the Scrum Masters.

External technical coaches who focus on training internal technical coaches

Have some technical coaches work with the teams, but let them focus on training internal coaches.
After that reduce (not eliminate!) the external technical coaching or let the external coach move to a new area.

=== Be Patient, The Time Horizon is Years

* Trust your people
* Create opportunities
* Establish a learning culture
* Let the team use internal social pressure
* Eliminate specialization, push mastery
* At the beginning follow the LeSS rules
* Extended responsibility, rounded products provides a room and freedom for better decisions

=== Remember

{ref-less} is {ref-scrum}, it is Large Scaled Scrum
Feature teams are economical and cross-functional
Technical excellence is the essence of a quality article
One article owner for the whole article provides focus

The article owner is where the money is.
Depending on your organization put him where the budget comes from.

Move component owner to become component mentor.
He is responsible to teach others how to adapt and evolve the component.
