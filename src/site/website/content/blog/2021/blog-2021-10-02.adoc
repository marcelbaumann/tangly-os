I truly love the new release rhythm of the Java ecosystem.
The new release JDK 17 is the next long term support _LTS_ release.
Being able to use new features every six months is awesome.
The migration overhead is held to a minimum thanks to the incredible backward compatibility.
The early-access builds give more than enough opportunity and time to migrate all your applications on time.

The new features greatly simplify existing code and tremendously increase legibility.

Algebraic data types are now complete with the official release of _records_ and _sealed types_.
The advanced pattern matching constructs enhance the functional programming capabilities in Java.

Polishing of functional programming approach improved my source code quite stupendously.
