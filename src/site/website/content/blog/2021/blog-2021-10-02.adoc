I truly love the new release rhythm of the Java ecosystem.
The new release JDK 17 is the next long term support _LTS_ release.
Being able to use new features every six months is awesome.
The migration overhead is held to a minimum thanks to the incredible backward compatibility.
The early-access builds give more than enough opportunity and time to migrate all your applications on time.

The new features greatly simplify existing code and tremendously increase legibility.

Algebraic data types are now complete with the official release of _records_ and _sealed types_.
The advanced pattern matching constructs enhance the functional programming capabilities in Java.

Polishing of functional programming approach improved my source code quite stupendously.

=== Why Should You Upgrade?

Why should you actually upgrade your application?
Every Java version, even minor versions offer performance benefits, but also security fixes.
Other useful extras that make your application more robust and better maintainable are often part of a new release.
It includes cool features, for instance, the recently released Java records, sealed types, or the pattern matching functionality.

I have noticed that a lot of applications are still on Java 8 or maybe even older, because upgrading is seen as quite a challenge.
It is often estimated that it's a lot of work, maybe even weeks or months of work to upgrade from one LTS version to the next LTS version of Java.
Then, when that information is being sent to the business, they often say, we don't have time to invest so much time now.
It is seen as a challenge difficult to estimate, and is automatically postponed.
That's not a good approach.

I try to make it more practical.
Actually, in the case of the weeks to months' estimation, I managed to do it in a couple of days.
It is often a matter of simply trying it, and if you're lucky, you manage to upgrade it quite easily.
Depending on what dependencies you use, or what code bases you use, it might be a bigger challenge.

== Should You Migrate Everytime?

Should we then stick to using LTS versions, or should we use the latest versions of Java?
If you have the time available, I would recommend using the latest version of Java because you can use the new features and improvements.
It always increases developer productivity and application reliability.
You have to do it every six months, because you cannot use the new minor versions.

If you do not have that time available to upgrade every six months, you might opt to using only the long term support versions.
However, then, each time you need to upgrade your long term support version, that actually might take quite a bit more time as well.
In the end, I think staying on long term support versions or using the latest version should not differ much in the investment in upgrading.

=== How Big is the Migration Effort?

When we start developing against the new Java version, it's recommended to start with your local machine, get that up and running first.
Then upgrade your build environment, so it supports the latest version of Java.
Get everything built and tested over there.
Then at the end, release it to the other environments, including the production environment.
When upgrading Java, you might upgrade from 8 to 17 at once.
If you've encountered any issues, it might be hard to pinpoint what's caused the exact issue.
Therefore, it might be better to do the migration, step by step.
Maybe you migrate from 8 to 11 first, or maybe from 8 to 9. Then if you encounter any issues, you can easily see what's changed in that Java version.
Answers can often by found through Google or StackOverflow.
That way, it's easier to get the upgrades done instead of in one big bang.

How do we move forward?
Now we start by compiling the source code on the new Java version, we run it.
If that succeeds, and we make the necessary fixes, we go to running the unit tests.
If we fix that as well, we can package the application, and in the end, we can run the application.
Based on the nice ingredients, we should get a nice result.
Of course, sometimes you miss some ingredients, or you lack a bit of time and you take some shortcuts.
That's perfectly fine.
