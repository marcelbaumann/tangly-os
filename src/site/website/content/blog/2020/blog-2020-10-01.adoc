I hosted my technical blogs on https://www.blogger.com/[blogger] for years.
If I currently remember I started to use blogger ten years ago.
It is a great tool with some drawbacks.
Over the years the drawbacks stinged more and more.

* Their editor is brittle, with limited functionality and unreliable.
 The generated HTML is not legible and does not support concepts such a micro fragments, meta information or simple functions such as source code highlighting.
* The last quarters they started to tinker with their editor and output format.
 My older posts are now a mess and can only be open in HTML mode.
 If I switch to the editor the layout is destroyed and random fonts family and sizes are displayed.
 Worse the blogs are also displayed mangled to the readers.
 This destruction of all older blogs and no documented migration path were killer criteria.
* Blogger does not support modern markup language such https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown] or {ref-asciidoc}.
 Blogger uses a proprietary and not easy to port format.

It is time to find an alternative.
I am a huge fan of {ref-asciidoc]}.

OK, so why not go with Markdown?
Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing bad with Markdown - except that no one should probably use it when {ref-asciidoc} and Asciidoctor are available.
I’m writing all my documents with {ref-asciidoc}.
The following needs are identified:

. I shall write blogs with the selected solution.
 The blogs shall be written in {ref-asciidoc}.
 The blog view should support multiple years of publishing and referencing between blogs.
 Our project and company put effort to publish regularly articles.
. I shall be able to write technical articles and publish them on the same site.
 The articles are naturally written in {ref-asciidoc}.
 We want a professional looking documentation to encourage new users to try our open source components.
. I shall publish the technical documentation of the open source components I develop on the same site.

{ref-hugo} was selected as static site generator because its support for {ref-asciidoc} is tremendously improving.

First I used the https://github.com/thingsym/hugo-theme-techdoc/[hugo-theme-techdoc] to customized {ref-hugo}.
It worked great for the technical documentation and technical articles but fall short of my wishes for the blog part.
When I discover the theme {ref-docsy}.
It supports the technical documentation, technical articles, and blogging.

The best part is that {ref-hugo} now supports {ref-asciidoctor} natively.
No more strange manipulation to load gem modules you need.
And diagrams through asciidoc-diagram and plantUml are generated in the expected folders.
The documentation is still on the light side but you find the needed information in the various pull requests.

The bonus is that {ref-asciidoctor} newer versions have native support for rouge syntax highlighter.
It is no more necessary to load pygment highlighter and configure CSS files.

=== Install the Tools

My development platform is a MacBookPro and MacOS. I use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] as a package manager.

The instructions to install hugo and asciidoctor are:

[code]
----
brew install hugo

brew install asciidoctor
gem install asciidoctor-diagram
gem install asciidoctor-rouge
gem install asciidoctor-html5s
gem install asciimath

brew install graphviz
brew install plantuml
----

=== Configuration of Asciidoctor

Below the configuration of asciidoctor in the _config.toml_ file.

[code, yaml]
----
[markup.asciidocext]
    extensions = ["asciidoctor-html5s", "asciidoctor-diagram"]
    workingFolderCurrent = true
    [markup.asciidocext.attributes]
        imagesdir = "../pics"
        source-highlighter = "rouge" // <1>
        rouge-style = "github" // <2>
        rouge-css = "style" // <3>
        icons = "font"  // <4>
        ref-less = "https://less.works/[LeSS]" // <5>
----
<1> Select https://rouge-ruby.github.io/docs/[rouge] as source highlighter.
 You should not add it to the extensions becouse since {ref-asciidoctor} version 2.0 rouge is included.
<2> Define the style used to highlight source code.
<3> Configure rouge to generate all formating data into the generated html file, avoiding any css file configuration.
<4> Icons provide better looking icons for various {ref-asciidoc}} constructs.
<5> Define document attributes which are accessible to all processed documents (DRY concept for the whole site).

=== Configuration of Docsy

==== Additional First Level Folders

Each time you add your own first level folder - meaning at the same level as docs, blog, about, or community you need to extend the layout to support it.
For example, I store technical articles in the folder ideas and use the standard template.
So I need to add (if not no items are visible in the side bar).

[code]
----
cp -R ./layouts/docs ./layouts/ideas
----

==== Change layouts

We had to change the partial _footer.html_ to display a better looking copyright clause.
The original version has hard coded text not really compatible with commons creative license we are using.
The layout is updated by overwriting the involved partial file.

[code]
-----
cp $prjDir/src/site/website/docsy/layouts/partials/footer.html $siteDir/themes/docsy/layouts/partials
----

=== Local Search Engine

One cool feature of {ref-docsy} is local search support through https://lunrjs.com/[lunrjs] engine.

[code, yaml]
----
algolia_docsearch = false

offlineSearch = true
offlineSearchSummaryLength = 200
offlineSearchMaxResults = 25
----

==== Learning

The static website is published under {ref-site}.

The source of the whole website is available under https://bitbucket.org/tangly-team/tangly-os/src/master/src/site/website/[Website Source Code].

You can use relative links in your {ref-asciidoc} documents.
Beware where the file are located by {ref-hugo} and the naming conventions.

Funny is that the blogger software and the docsy theme are from the same company *Google*.
