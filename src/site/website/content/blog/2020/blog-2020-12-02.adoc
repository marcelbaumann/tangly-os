There are times in software when you're facing a problem, you find an off-the-shelf solution, and 20 lines of code later it just works.

Today I lived one of those moments.

=== Motivation

I wanted to add a comments section to this blog for a while.
I was reluctant to implement one myself the classical way, using an external service such as disqus.
This blog does not use a database.
All pages are static AsciiDoc content stored in a repository and rendered using Hugo.
I wanted to store comments in a personally owned repository and protect my readers from advertisement and personal information collection.

=== Meeting Utteranc.es

Some information on the Internet about https://utteranc.es/[utteranc.es] is wrong.
Facts are:

* Utterances uses a github repository to store comments of your website articles and pages.
* Your website can be hosted *anywhere*.
You do *not* need to host your static website repository on github; but you can.
* Readers wanting to comment *must* login once with their github account to authorize the utterances application.
Anonymous commenting is not supported.
This restriction is reasonable for a technical website which readers are technical affine and already have a github account.
* Utterances is free.
No tracking, no advertisement, no lock-in.
The comments are stored in your repository as GitHub issues.
* Utterances layout looks nice and can be styled.

Utterances is an open source app built and maintained by Jeremy Danyow which he announced in 2018.
It provides a lightweight web widget (an <iframe>) to add a comment section to a website.

When someone posts a comment, the Utterances bot literally leaves a corresponding comment on the issue.
In other words, each page gets its own issue with a comment feed, and so you benefit from the entire feature set of issues out-of-the-box.

* Comments are stored in issues of a GitHub repo of your choosing.
* You can edit, report and delete comments.
These functions are great for moderation.
* If you are watching the repository, you will get email notifications when comments are posted to your site.

The other wonderful aspect about Utterances is how simple the entire setup really is.

=== Setting Up Utterances

The process is described https://utteranc.es/[Here].
The steps are:

. Create a public GitHub repository.
. Install the utterances app on the repo you would like to host comments on.
You can used the repository of your blog, or setup a dedicated repository.
This option means your blog or website does not need to be hosted on GitHub.
. Configure the code snippet on the utterances website and copy it.

[TIP]
====
You can skip the code snippet step if you are using Docsy and follow the below instructions to configure your theme.
====

[code,javascript]
----
<script
  async
  src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
  repo="<OWNER>/<NAME>" // <1>
  issue-term="title"
  theme="github-light"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
</script>
----
<1> <OWNER>/<NAME> is the name of your repository.
In my case it would be _marcelbaumann/tangly-team-comments_.

=== Configure Docsy Theme

I use the Hugo theme https://www.docsy.dev/[Docsy] to style the {ref-site}.
I put some effort to have a configurable extension through site prameters.

==== Create the comments partial for utterances

The partial file contains the code to display for commenting using utterances.
It is a modified version of the snippet you can generate on the utterances website.

Create a partial in _docsy/layout/partial_.
I named my partial _comments-utterances.html_ and add the following snippet.

[code,html]
----
<div class="page-blank">
    <div id="utterancers_thread"></div>
    <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
            repo= {{ .Site.Params.comments_utterances_repo }}
            issue-term="pathname"  // <1>
            theme="github-light"   // <2>
            crossorigin="anonymous"
            async>
    </script>
</div>
----
<1> See utterances documentation how the reference to the page or articles can be tailored
<2> See utterances documentation about supported themes

== Edit the blog content file

The template _docsy/layouts/blog/content.html_ is edited to include the above defined partial file.
The original file supports connecting to disqus.
I replaced the disqus specific code with the inclusion of the partial defined above for utterances comment support.

[code,html]
----
<div class="td-content">
	<h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>
	{{ with .Params.description }}<div class="lead">{{ . | markdownify }}</div>{{ end }}
	<div class="td-byline mb-4">
		{{ with .Params.author }}{{ T "post_byline_by" }} <b>{{ . | markdownify }}</b> |{{ end}}
		<time datetime="{{  $.Date.Format "2006-01-02" }}" class="text-muted">{{ $.Date.Format $.Site.Params.time_format_blog  }}</time>
	</div>
	{{ if (and (not .Params.hide_readingtime) (.Site.Params.ui.readingtime.enable)) }}
	    {{ partial "reading-time.html" . }}
	{{ end }}
	{{ .Content }}
	{{ if (.Site.Params.comments_utterances) }}
		<br />
		{{ partial "comments-utterances.html" . }}
		<br />
	{{ end }}

	{{ partial "pager.html" . }}
</div>
----

=== Add two site variables to config.toml

The above changes try to be generic and are configured through site variables in the site configuration file under the _[params]_ block.

[code,toml]
----
# flag indicating if the utterances (https://utteranc.es/) should be displayed
comments_utterances = true

# GitHub repository name where all comments are stored. The repository can be the same as the website repository or a different one.
comments_utterances_repo = "owner/repository-name" # <1>
----
<1> Set the value to your GitHub repository where the comments should be stored.
