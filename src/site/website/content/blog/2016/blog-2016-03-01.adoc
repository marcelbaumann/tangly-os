As a young developer I loved Linux, compiled new kernels during evening sessions and struggled days to have the correct drivers for the graphic card and communication components of my notebook.

I grew older and decided to enjoy my evenings and weekends.
And surely I would prefer to have no virus, trojan and other evils on my workstation.
So I went to MacOS and Apple notebooks without regrets.

=== Gains

The major gains upon migrating to OS X are

* No virus scanner is necessary, the speed-up during complex programming and development activities are tremendous,
* No trouble when updating OS, updates are automatic and often no new start is required,
* Unix Command Line and Tools are available in the console.
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] or https://www.macports.org/[MacPorts] projects provide all known and less-known utilities and programs available under Linux,
* Long Lived Notebook is still working and looking nice after five years of daily usage.
 The performance is more than adequate for software development with Java 8/9/10/11 stack and C++.

=== Daily Development

The tools I really enjoy and use on a daily basis for software development - mainly Java - are

* IntelliJ IDEA IDE,
* Atlassian Cloud applications - BitBucket, HipChat, CI pipeline -,
* https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] as package manager for utilities,
* Docker as container manager,
* VirtualBox when I need a full-fledged virtual machine.

=== Daily Work

The tools I use to perform administrative work are

* LibreOffice,
* Google Business for team work in the cloud using collaborative tools,
* Apple Mail Client with GPG plugin for PGP and S/MIME secure email,
* A local Swiss article https://www.banana.ch[Banana] for accounting and VAT reports for the federal government.
 I bought it as soon as the company stopped requesting higher prices for OS X than for the other platforms.

LibreOffice completely replaced Microsoft Office suite.
I stopped using OpenOffice after the strange behavior of Oracle with the application.

I never really regretted leaving Linux or Ubuntu behind me.
