You are working in a small colocated development team and decided to use branches to implement new features or fix errors.
Here the cookbook to create, edit, merge and delete local and remote branches in Git (version 2.x).
Git branches have two important qualities

* A branch is like an idea. Once you implemented the idea, feature or fix you just delete the branch,
* The history of the branch commits is still visible upon deletion of the branch.

_You should use meaningful names for your branch name and associated commit messages._
_Put the ticket number into the branch name and messages for future searches._

A lot of servers support keywords such "fix #42" to automatically close the ticket 42.

The described approach is optimal for small teams.
The approach is compatible to pull requests if you introduce later such a workflow.
If you are working co-located you do not need pull requests. I prefer pair programming and pair check-in sessions.

For a short introduction how to start using Git in software projects see previous blog
link:../../2017/git-local-repositories-for-impatient[Git Local Repositories for the Impatient].

=== Create the Branch

Create new branch feat_#42 locally

[code]
----
git checkout -b feat_#42
----

Create the remote branch with the same name and initiate tracking

[code]
----
git push -u origin feat_#42
----

=== Work on the Branch

Do some changes and commit them regularly

[code]
----
git commit -a -m “commit message describing activities for feat_#42“
----

Push the changes to repository

[code]
----
git push
----

_Now you can test the branch from the central repository and deploy it to a continuous integration server or a test environment._

=== Merge the Branch

Switch to master and synchronize with repository, the _-p_ parameter means __--prune__

[code]
----
git checkout master
git fetch --all -p
git pull
----

Merge to master. The option --no-ff will always keep branch information

[code]
----
git merge --no-ff feat_#42
----

Or if you want a single commit for the complete branch

[code]
----
git merge —squash —no-ff feat_#42
----

Push the changes

[code]
----
git push
----

=== Delete the Branch

Delete the remote branch (also git branch -dr origin/feat_#42)

[code]
----
git push origin --delete feat_#42
----

Delete the local branch

[code]
----
git branch -d feat_#42
----

You are done. Now you are ready to implement the next feature.

=== View local and remote Branches

If you want to view branches use the following commands for the local branches

[code]
----
git branch
git branch --no-merged
----

If you want to view remote branches

[code]
----
git branch -r
git branch -r --no-merged
----

Checkout remote Branch

The -p parameter means --prune

[code]
----
git fetch --all -p
git checkout #feat_42
----

==More Information

You can find a lot of information on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git[Stack Overflow].
Beware that the Git commands have changed over time.
Select new posts to find the best answers.
The nitty-gritty details can be found in the official https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Git documentation].

Beware that for example http://gitolite.com/[gitolite] does not support special characters such as # in branch names.
Use them only in the commit messages.
These same characters work in https://bitbucket.org/[bitbucket].
