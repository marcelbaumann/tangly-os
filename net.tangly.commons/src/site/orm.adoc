=== Purpose
Orm provides a mapper between Java objects and relational databases. Major design constraints were

* The persisted Java classes do not need to be edited. The framework does not rely on inheritance or annotations to perform its duty,
* No byte code manipulation. The POJO are not modified by the ORM library,
* No external configuation based on XML or JSON,
* Only a basic set of operations and abstractions are supported, no advanced capabilities are provided.

Interactions with ORM have two parts. You build a DAO using a DAO builder. The DAO defines the mapping between a Java class with all its properties
and relations to other classes.

=== Entities

Using the library means accepting some restrictions on how your entities both the Java classes and the SQL schema are designed. Some of these
restrictions are good practices regardless of how database and object models are built.

==== Java Objects
Every entity class should have a *Long* identifier field named *oid* that will be used as a primary key. The library will populate this field. The
primary key will be used when the library performs updates. The library expects to work with entities with public getters and setters or
with entities with public getters for fields and related builder objects or constructors with setters for the individual fields.

==== SQL Schema
The library expects every table to have a numeric primary key. The library will populate the primary keys on inserts with value.

=== Relations
One point of usign a relational databs as opposed to a document store or other mechanism is to preserve the structure of relations between
entities. The library supports three kinds of relationships: owner - ownees relation where an owner owns a set of objects, entity - entities relation
where an entity has a relation with a set of objects, and entities - entities where multiple entities have a relation with multiple other entities
meaning a n-m relationship.

==== Owner - Ownees
The owner entity owns the ownee objects, so that the ownee existence depends on the existence of the owner.

One tricky thing about these relationships is the reversal in how ownership is expressed between the database schema and the object model. In the
object model the owner has ownees, in the database the ownee has a foreign key reference to the owner.

==== Entity - Entities
These are relations betweent wo objects where one objrect refers in a dependent but not controlling way.


==== Entities - Entities

==== Data Access Objects DAO

=== Decisions

=== History

* The initial implementation is tested against hsqldb. No effort was invested to test compatibility with other databases. The port should be
straight forward because we are using plain JDBC statements.
